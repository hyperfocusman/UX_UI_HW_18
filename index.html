           <h2>UX Design</h2>
            <p>Research and scope live at the top of my priorities. I'm also very comfortable with an agile and non-linear process. </p>

           <h2>Prototyping</h2></div>
            <p>I like to make things and present them. Much of my presentation skills were developed pitching public art projects and events. </p>

            <h2>Spatial Design</h2>
            <p>AR is my current focus as I explore ways to prototype my ideas and learn interactive design. Tools I’m using include Figma’s Bezel plugin and (Unity?).
